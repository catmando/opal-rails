_Rails bindings for [Opal](http://opalrb.com). ([Changelog](https://github.com/opal/opal-rails/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md))_

### Looking for Webpack support? üëÄ

If you want to integrate Opal via Webpack please refer to [opal-webpack-loader](https://github.com/isomorfeus/opal-webpack-loader#installation) installation instructions.

‚ÑπÔ∏è Webpack and ES6 modules are not yet officially supported, but we're working on it thanks to the awesome work done in _opal-webpack-loader_.


## Installation

In your `Gemfile`

```ruby
gem 'opal-rails'
```

Add `app/assets/javascript` to your asset-pipeline manifest in `app/assets/config/manifest.js`:

```
bin/rails opal:install
```


### Configuration

Add your configuration in `config/initializers/assets.rb` with the following contents:

```ruby
# Compiler options
Rails.application.config.opal.method_missing           = true
Rails.application.config.opal.optimized_operators      = true
Rails.application.config.opal.arity_check_enabled      = !Rails.env.production?
Rails.application.config.opal.const_missing            = true
Rails.application.config.opal.dynamic_require_severity = :ignore

# Note that arity_check_enabled must be true to get a meaningful result
# for Method#parameters

# Other options

# Send local and instance variables down to the view after converting
# thier value with `.to_json`
Rails.application.config.opal.assigns_in_templates = true
Rails.application.config.opal.assigns_in_templates = :locals # only locals
Rails.application.config.opal.assigns_in_templates = :ivars # only instance variables
```

For a full list of the available configuration options for the compiler please refer to: [lib/opal/config.rb](https://github.com/opal/opal/blob/master/lib/opal/config.rb).



## Usage

### Basic example

1. Rename `app/assets/javascripts/application.js` to `app/assets/javascripts/application.js.rb`
2. Replace the Sprockets directives with plain requires

```ruby
# Require the opal runtime and core library
require 'opal'

# For Rails 5.1 and above, otherwise use 'opal_ujs'
require 'rails_ujs'

# Require of JS libraries will be forwarded to sprockets as is
require 'turbolinks'

# a Ruby equivalent of the require_tree Sprockets directive is available
require_tree '.'

puts "hello world!"
```

### A more extensive example

```ruby
require 'opal'
require 'opal_ujs'
require 'turbolinks'
require_tree '.' # a Ruby equivalent of the require_tree Sprockets directive is available

# ---- YOUR FANCY RUBY CODE HERE ----
#
# Examples:

# == Print something in the browser's console
puts "Hello world!"
pp hello: :world
require 'console'
$console.log %w[Hello world!]

# == Use Native to wrap native JS objects, $$ is preconfigured to wrap `window`
require 'native'
$$.alert "Hello world!"

# == Do some DOM manipulation with jQuery
require 'opal-jquery'
Document.ready? do
  Element.find('body').html = '<h1>Hello world!</h1>'
end

# == Or access the DOM api directly
$$[:document].addEventListener(:DOMContentLoaded, -> {
  $$[:document].querySelector('body')[:innerHTML] = '<h1>Hello world!</h1>'
})

```


### Using Sprockets directives and `application.js`

If you want to use `application.js` (instead of `application.js.rb`) and keep using Sprockets directives, you'll need to load the Opal files you require via Sprockets manually, e.g.:

```js
//= require opal
//= require rails_ujs
//= require turbolinks
//= require_tree .
//= require app

Opal.require('opal');
Opal.require('app');
```


### As a template

You can use it for your views too:

```ruby
# app/controllers/posts_controller.rb

def create
  @post = Post.create!(params[:post])
  render type: :js, locals: {comments_html: render_to_string(@post.comments)}
end
```

Assigned instance that would normally be available in your views are converted to JSON objects first.

```ruby
# app/views/posts/create.js.opal

post = Element.find('.post')
post.find('.title').html    = @post[:title]
post.find('.body').html     = @post[:body]
post.find('.comments').html = comments_html
```

#### Instance and local variables in templates

By default `opal-rails` will forward any instance and local variable you'll pass to the template.

This behavior can be disabled by setting `Rails.application.config.opal.assigns_in_templates` to `false` in `config/initializers/assets.rb`:

```ruby
Rails.application.config.opal.assigns_in_templates = false
```



### As a Haml filter (optional)

Of course you need to require `haml-rails` separately since its presence is not assumed

```haml
-# app/views/posts/show.html.haml

%article.post
  %h1.title= post.title
  .body= post.body

%a#show-comments Display Comments!

.comments(style="display:none;")
  - post.comments.each do |comment|
    .comment= comment.body

:opal
  Document.ready? do
    Element.find('#show-comments').on :click do |click|
      click.prevent_default
      click.current_target.hide
      Element.find('.comments').effect(:fade_in)
    end
  end
```


### RSpec support

_Extracted to (unreleased) [`opal-rspec-rails`](https://github.com/opal/opal-rspec-rails)_

Add this line to your `Gemfile`:

```ruby
gem 'opal-rspec-rails', github: 'opal/opal-rspec-rails'
```


### Minitest support

_Upcoming as `opal-minitest-rails`_


### Shared templates

As long as the templates are inside the Sprockets/Opal load path, then you should be able to just require them.

Let's say we have this template `app/views/shared/test.haml`:

```haml
.row
  .col-sm-12
    = @bar
```

We need to make sure Opal can see and compile that template. So we need to add the path to sprockets:

```ruby
# config/initializers/opal.rb
Rails.application.config.assets.paths << Rails.root.join('app', 'views', 'shared').to_s
```

Now, somewhere in `application.rb` you need to require that template, and you can just run it through `Template`:

```ruby
# app/assets/javascripts/application.rb
require 'opal'
require 'opal-haml'
require 'test'

@bar = "hello world"

template = Template['test']
template.render(self)
# =>  '<div class="row"><div class="col-sm-12">hello world</div></div>'
```


### Using Ruby gems from Opal

Just use `Opal.use_gem` in your asset initializer (`config/initializers/assets.rb`).

Example:

```ruby
Opal.use_gem 'cannonbol'
```


## Contributing

Run the specs:

```
bin/setup
bin/rake
```

Inspect the test app:

```
bin/rackup
# visit localhost:9292
```

Tinker with a sandbox app:

```
bin/sandbox # will re-create the app
bin/rails s # will start the sandbox app server
# visit localhost:3000
```
